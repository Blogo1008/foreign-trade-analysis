In this project, I scraped titles from a foreign trade forum (http://bbs.fobshanghai.com/). Then I counted frequently discussed words and performed association rules
analysis using these words in order to classify the demands from foreign trade companies. The result is in the file "Foreign Trade Business Demand Report.docx".
